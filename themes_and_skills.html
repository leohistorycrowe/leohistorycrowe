            <h2>U.S. History Theme 1 - Migration and Settlement</h2>
            <p>My project directly addresses the Mormon migration westward, examining how religious persecution and social pressures forced the Mormons to leave the eastern United States and seek refuge in Utah. I will explore why the Mormons chose to migrate, how they adapted to new physical and social environments in Utah, and how their settlement shaped the region, overall analyzing the push and pull factors behind their migration and the transformation of Utah as a result of their settlement.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>U.S. History Theme 2 - Politics and Power</h2>
            <p>The political conflicts that led to Mormon persecution, particularly how state and local governments viewed the Mormon Church’s influence and practices, relate to this theme. I will explore how the power struggles between the Mormons and their neighbors, and between the Mormons and local governments, influenced their decision to migrate. Additionally, I will discuss how the Utah War, which occurred after the Mormon Migration, highlights the political tensions and power struggles between the federal government and the Mormon settlers over governance in the Utah Territory.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Historical Thinking Skill 4.A - Identify and Describe Historical Context</h2>
            <p>I will use this skill to describe the broader social, political, and religious context that led to the persecution of Mormons in the eastern United States. This includes the rise of religious movements in the 19th century, the growing tension between different religious groups, and the political instability in regions like Illinois and Missouri. By identifying this context, I can show how these factors created an environment hostile to the Mormons, eventually forcing their migration westward.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Historical Thinking Skill 6.B: Support an Argument with Evidence</h2>
            <p>I will apply this skill to build a strong argument about how persecution led to the Mormon migration and the settlement of Utah. I can support my argument using specific historical evidence, such as incidents like the Missouri Executive Order 44 (which sanctioned violence against Mormons), the conflicts in Nauvoo, and the Mormons' decision to move west under Brigham Young’s leadership. Through this evidence, I can discuss the cause-and-effect relationship between persecution and migration.</p>
